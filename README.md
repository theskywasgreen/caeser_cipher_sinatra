# Caeser Cipher
This is a basic implementation of the [Caeser Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) built using Sinatra for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).
The Caeser Cipher can wrap from Z to A and allows both upper and lower case entries aswell as a mixture. The Caeser Cipher will ignore non-alphabetical characters and output them as they are.

## The Caeser Cipher works as follows -
Enter a word or sentence you wish to cipher into the "string" input field.
Enter how many letters you want to shift each letter by (i.e 5 would shift each letter 5 letters down the alphabet) into the shift factor input.
Press submit and your ciphered word/sentence will appear on the screen.
