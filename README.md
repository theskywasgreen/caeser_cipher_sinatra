This is my implementation of the Caeser Cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) built using Sinatra for The Odin Project.
The Caeser Cipher can wrap from Z to A and allows both upper and lower case entries aswell as a mixture. The Caeser Cipher will ignore non-alphabetical characters and output them as they are.

The Caeser Cipher works as follows -
Enter a word or sentence you wish to cipher into the "string" input field.
Enter how many letters you want to shift each letter by (i.e 5 would shift each letter 5 letters down the alphabet).
Press submit and your ciphered word/sentence will appear on the screen.
